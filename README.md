matlab to paython ground truth



To achive that you must save the ground truth as tabel , not as ground truth.
if you have more than one class ,you must do it class by class .(the tabel is only two coulm(image name- boxing))
export gtruth as tabel in workspace
run the code 
note
to avoid any problem with image names(if have more than one class) rename all images with deffrent names because in python , they will be put in one folder.
